## Which package/library does your code demonstrate?
###### OpenCV and mediapipe
While the library of choice was openCV, the package is limited to only a few functionalities and is generally considered as slow. However, openCV used with functionalities of mediapipe make for a much more exciting program. OpenCV is a imageprocessing library, capable of identifying objects using machinelearning. However, mediapipe allows for further identifications of said objects, like currency of a coin or type of animal, or in this case, fingers on a hand.
## How does someone run your program?
If openCV and mediapipe are already installed, simply running the code in an IDE like VScode or through the terminal is sufficient.
## What purpose does your program serve?
The purpose is to count the amount of fingers a person is showing, this may be useful in interactive AI.
## What is the sample output/input?
Input is a series of images (in other words, video) processed through the program. The output is another image, with the number of fingers displayed by the user on the frame itself. It is also displayed in real time.

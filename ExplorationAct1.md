### Which package/library did you select?
OpenCV was my library of choice.
### What is the package/library?
OpenCV, short for open source computer vision, is a computer vision and machine learning. 
• What purpose does it serve?
It serves as an image processing and computer vision library. It provides functions like imeage reading and writing, detecting objects, recognizing patterns, etc.
• How do you use it?
It has several, common, use cases:
- Image loading and displaying
- Object/feature detection
- Maching learning integration
All of these are
### What are the functionalities of the package/library?
OpenCV has lots of functionalities, including:
- Image and video IO
```
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
```
The snippet of code captures video
```
cv2.imshow("Hand Detection", frame)
```
The snippet of code projects and image
```
cv2.putText(frame, toString, (0, 200), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_COMPLEX, 1, (255, 0, 0), 2)
```
The snippet of code adds text to the image
The basic functionalities are similar to the ```slideshow``` language in racket, drawing and adding to an image. However the library can go much more in depth.
### When was it created?
OpenCV was created in the late 1990s by Intel, and has gone through several iterations since its release. 
### Why did you select this package/library?
I am very interested in artificial inteligence, data manipulation and machine learning. Although image processing is quite basic data manipulation. The use of machine learning for the program has only grown my inspiration to develop more in the domain. 
### How did learning the package/library influence your learning of the language?
Python, although simple at its core, has a very large number of libraries and packages. Now that I have learnt how to utilize one library (or 2). I am eager to learn more. 
### How was your overall experience with the package/library?
Although it was hard, and at first I did not understand it, the more I understood the more I wanted to utilize its capabilities.
• When would you recommend this package/library to someone?
Yes I would.
• Would you continue using this package/library? Why or why not?
I would, but like my example, I would need to pair it with another package, as the other package will bring out the best of openCV.
